# OOSE Kap 4. Requirements Elicitation
Seems like an old text the concepts are not clear/consice and the requirements for maintaining this type of documentation when the system adds just a bit of complexity seems unsustainable.

## Scenario based requirements elicitation
Goal - describe the purpose of the system

developers
    * constructs 
users
clients

Methods:
    observation
        Construct model of appilcation domain by observig users
    interview 

Requirements
  * Feature
  * Constraint

Requirements engineering 2 main activities 
    * both requirements specification and analasis model should contain the same info differ only in language and notation
    * Requirements elicitation -> specification(Client understands)
        * focus on users point of view
            * user system interaction
            * enviromental factores
            * errors detected 
        * activities see page 3pdf/158book
            * identifying actors (users)
            * identifying scenarios via observation
            * identifying usecases 
            * refining usecases
            * identifying relationships between usecases
            * identifying nonfunctional requirements
        * tools for bridging knowlage gap
            * senarios
            * use case
        * Define problem area a.k.a What should the application
        * Is a contract between developers clients 
        * written in natural language
    * Aalasis -> analasis model(unambiguose to developers)
        * facilitate communication between developers

recored users current workflow as "as-is scenarios"
develop "visionary scenarios" that future system provides
client and users validates "visionary scenarios" by review and prototypes

as system matures and stabilizes developers and clients agree on "requirements specification" as
    * functional requirements
    * non-functional requirements
    * use cases
    * scenarios

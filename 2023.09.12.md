## context:
    business-critical enterprise application
    deliver changes rapidly, frequently and reliably - dora
    business to thrive in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world
    engineering organization is organized into small, loosely coupled, cross-functional teams
    using DevOps practices
    team is responsible for one or more subdomains aka DDD aggregates

## Problem: 
How to organize the subdomains into one or more deployable/executable components?

## Benefits
    All operations are local
    All operations can be implemented as an ACID transaction since there’s a single database
    There’s no runtime coupling since there’s a single component
    There’s no design-time coupling between multiple components

## Drawbacks
    Potentially difficult to understand and maintain due its the application’s size and complexity
    Potentially less team autonomy - all teams are contributed to the same code base so they need to coordinate their work more often
    Potentially slow deployment pipeline - since there’s a single large application that needs to be built and tested
    Single technology stack - the application uses a single technology stack, which might not be ideal for all subdomains. If it the application is large upgrading the technology stack might be very time consuming
    No possibility of segregating subdomains by their characteristics, which might reduce scalability, availabilty, security etc

These drawbacks become more severe as the application grows in size and complexity and the number of teams developing it increases.

    using DevOps practices
    team is responsible for one or more subdomains aka DDD aggregates

## Problem: 
How to organize the subdomains into one or more deployable/executable components?

# Benefits
    Simple services - each service consists of a small number of subdomains - possibly just one - and so is easier to understand and maintain
    Team autonomy - a team can develop, test and deploy their service independently of other teams
    Fast deployment pipeline - each service is fast to test since it’s relatively small, and can be deployed independently
    Support multiple technology stacks - different services can use different technology stacks and can be upgraded independently
    Segregate subdomains by their characteristics - subdomains can be segregated by their characteristics into separate services in order to improve scalability, availabilty, security etc

## Drawback
    Some distributed operations might be complex, and difficult to understand and troubleshoot
    Some distributed operations might be potentially inefficient
    Some operations might need to be implemented using complex, eventually consistent (non-ACID) transaction management since loose coupling requires each service to have its own database.
    Some distributed operations might involve tight runtime coupling between services, which reduces their availability.
    Risk of tight design-time coupling between services, which requires time consuming lockstep changes
